## Overview

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify job descriptions into predefined response categories. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest Classifier. The goal is to predict the correct response category for a given job description based on its content.
