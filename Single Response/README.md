## Overview

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify job descriptions into predefined response categories. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest Classifier. The goal is to predict the correct response category for a given job description based on its content.


## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed. You'll also need to install the required libraries before running the code. The necessary libraries include:

##### nltk : Natural Language Toolkit for text processing
##### pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
##### scikit-learn : Machine learning library for Python

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk pandas scikit-learn
```
## Project Structure

**- single_response.csv**: The dataset containing job descriptions and their corresponding labels (response categories).

**- Single Response**.ipynb: The main Python script that preprocesses the data, trains machine learning models, and makes predictions.


## How It Works
**1. Data Preprocessing**:
The raw job descriptions are cleaned and preprocessed using NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stopwords removal.
The processed text is then converted into TF-IDF features for model training.

**2. Model Training**:
Three different machine learning models are trained using a pipeline structure:

- **Logistic Regression**

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

- **Random Forest Classifier**

-Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the best model for each classifier.

**3. Model Evaluation**:

- The models are evaluated on a test set, and their performance is compared based on accuracy and classification reports.
  
**4. Prediction**:

- The best-performing model is used to predict response categories for new job descriptions.

## Usage

**1. Run the Script**:
- Execute the Single Response.ipynb script to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

**2. Predict New Job Descriptions**:

- After training, you can use the predict_responses() function to predict the response category for new job descriptions.

Example:
```
job_descriptions = [
    "Manage university financial reports and budget forecasting.",
    "Assist in organizing office files and managing schedules."
]
predicted_responses = predict_responses(job_descriptions)
for job_desc, response in zip(job_descriptions, predicted_responses):
    print(f'Job Description: {job_desc}\nPredicted Response: {response}\n')
```
