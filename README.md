# Job Description Classification and Response Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains three Python scripts for classifying job descriptions and predicting responses to various questions using different machine learning models.

- **Model 1**: Implements text classification using Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
- **Model 2**: Multi-output classification using XGBoost to predict responses to multiple questions.
- **Model 3**: Utilizes BERT embeddings and a combination of classifiers to handle imbalanced datasets and interpret models using SHAP.

## Installation
